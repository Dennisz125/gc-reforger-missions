  "- The hostages must not intentionally risk their life (e. g. do not run away if there is a chance you might get shot), and respond realistically to the threat of violence."\
  "- For the same reason, the hostages cannot simply try to run away on their own, they can only leave the compound when being rescued."\
  "- Hostages must respect reasonable \"roleplay actions\", e. g. they cannot open doors that are closed and presumably locked behind them or move if they were \"restrained\"."\
  "- The hostage takers also have zip cuffs available which can be used to physically restrain the hostage, for that the hostage must surrender by pressing F1."\
  "- The hostage takers cannot bring the hostages away from the compound or swap clothes."\
  "-  While threats can be made, the hostage takers should not kill hostages unless it is deemed absolutely necessary. The hostages are valuable leverage, and there is no inherent benefit to killing them."
